# angular-box-drag
jQueryUI is great, and one of its cool features is the ability to make an element draggable.

AngularJS has directives out there which allow you to drag and drop, but not all user interface scenarios for dragging require
you to also do a drop. I tried looking for other angular directives out there that were purely for making an element draggable 
without relying on jQuery or jQueryUI, and was not happy with the results. Thus, this directive is an attempt for a pure
angular way of making draggable elements. Please note this relates to a fairly specific use case: being able to open a box like
the Compose box you see in GMail, and then being able to drag that box around. 

Hopefully, more documentation and description of options to follow. 

In the meantime, here is an example page using the directive.
